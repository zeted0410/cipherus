        <h2>The Cipherus is my first website project. This puzzle aims to solve the password, known as a cipher. The Player can discover many hints in the project, and it is all connected to one password. Players will enjoy this game by discovering new passwords from other people. The puzzle will be added after 2 months, so you have a lot of time! 
            The reason why I made this <a onclick="secret()">p</a>roject is I wanted to make the ARG puzzle. ARG means “Alternate Reality Game”, which is a type of interactive storytelling where players come together to solve puzzles and tasks to progress through the story arc. This project is also an ARG puzzle. Players should solve puzzles to progress through the story. 
            These Puzzles need to use a lot of programming or cipher languages such as ASCII. You also should EXPLORE the website, and there are a lot of things on this website. When you solve the puzzle, do not ignore anything on this website. 
            Hope you enjoy the puzzles!
